# A note on rect syntax: Cross sections are made of rectangles, which are parsed according to the following syntax rules:
# Basic syntax: [<x>, <y>, <width>, <height>]
#   Specify the bottom left corner of the rectangle and its width and height
# Named syntax: <name>:[<x>, <y>, <width>, <height>]
#   Same as above, but now the rect will be given a name, which can be referenced later; note the colon
# Slice syntax: <cross_section>:<name>[w=<start>:<stop>, h=<start>:<stop>]:<newname>
#   Slice (change the size or move) an existing rect and optionally give it a new name (newname)
#   cross_section is optional and specifies the cross section that name belongs to
#   name is the name of another rect, used as the base of the slice (required)
#   In the [], w and h can be used in any order (or even not at all); w specifies a widthwise slice, and h specifies a heightwise slice
#   start and stop are where to begin and end the slice; by default they are relative to the left/bottom of the rect,
#   but you can use a star (e.g. *123) to make it relative to the right/top of the rect; negative numbers are accepted
#   Both start and stop are optional, and default to 0 and the width/height of the rect respectively if omitted;
#   however, the colon is required (e.g. my_cs:my_name[w=:]:my_new_name is a valid slice)
